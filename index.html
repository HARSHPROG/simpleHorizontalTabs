		<p>
			Also, in Asymptotic analysis, we always
			talk about input sizes larger than a
			constant value. It might be possible
			that those large inputs are never given
			to your software and an algorithm which is
			asymptotically slower, always performs
			better for your particular situation.
			So, you may end up choosing an algorithm
			that is Asymptotically slower but faster
			for your software.

			Asymptotic Analysis is the big idea
			that handles above issues in analyzing
			algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis,
			we evaluate the performance of an
			algorithm in terms of input size (we
			donâ€™t measure the actual running time).
			We calculate, how does the time
			(or space) taken by an algorithm
			increases with the input size.

		<h3>Python</h3>

		<p>
			Python is a high-level, general-purpose
			and a very popular programming language.
			Python programming language (latest Python 3)
			is being used in web development, Machine
			Learning applications, along with all
			cutting edge technology in Software Industry.
			Python Programming Language is very well
			suited for Beginners, also for experienced
			programmers with other programming languages
			like C++ and Java.

		<h3>Greedy Algorithms</h3>

		<p>
			Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that
			builds up a solution piece by piece,
			always choosing the next piece that
			offers the most obvious and immediate
			benefit. So the problems where
			choosing locally optimal also
			leads to global solution are
			best fit for Greedy.

	<div id="machine" class="contentClass">
		<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

		<p>
			Machine Learning is the field of
			study that gives computers the capability
			to learn without being explicitly
			programmed. ML is one of the most
			exciting technologies that one
			would have ever come across.
			As it is evident from the name,
			it gives the computer that makes
			it more similar to humans:
			The ability to learn. Machine learning
			is actively being used today,
			perhaps in many more places than
			one would expect.
